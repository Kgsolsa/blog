# About

Welcome to **Astro Modular**, an Astro blog theme template designed for Obsidian users, created by [David V. Kimball](https://davidvkimball.com). This theme bridges the gap between Obsidian's powerful note-taking capabilities and modern web publishing.

## Our Philosophy

Great content deserves great presentation without complexity. This blog theme is built on four core principles:

### Clarity First
Content should be the star, not the design. Every element is carefully crafted to enhance readability and focus attention on what matters most - your ideas and writing.

### Performance Matters
Fast loading times and smooth interactions are not optional. Every aspect of this theme has been optimized to deliver exceptional performance across all devices with 95+ Lighthouse scores.

### Obsidian Compatibility
If you use Obsidian for note-taking and content creation, this theme feels like a natural extension of your workflow. Wikilinks, markdown formatting, and hotkeys work seamlessly between your vault and published site.

### Modular Design
Every feature can be toggled on or off through a single configuration file. Enable only what you need, keeping your site fast and focused on your specific use case.
